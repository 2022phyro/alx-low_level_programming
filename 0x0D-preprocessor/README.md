This readme contains files, header files which are more or less practice work on Macros. Here we define some simple user macros and watch them simplify our codes. We also see the importance of the preprocessor in the transformation of the source fike to an executable. This repository contains the following files:
0-object-like-macro.h: creates a macro that has the value 1024
1-pi.h: creates a macro with the value of pi
2-main.c: A program that prints the name of the file using a predefined macro __FILE__
3-function-like-macro.h: creattes a function like ma ro that returns thr absolute value of a number
4-sum.h: A macro that sums up two nunbers.
NB: The above files are all header files except for 2-main.c ehivh is a program.
The following codes in this repo were created by the owner. Please do not steal and do nkt tamper with the codes
This project is part of the alx software engineering curriculum
